This is the first code review from Marco HÃ¤fner during the Bootcamp Full Stack Developer Course at Code Factory (FSWD50).
> one issue left: this is the not responsive iframe, if you are using a relative height for it. The height is unknown of the iframe (because the content is also dynamic). JavaScript could solve that problem. There is also a solution from Ben Marshall (https://benmarshall.me/responsive-iframes/), though I couldn't get this running.
